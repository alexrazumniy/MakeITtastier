This project was created to explore some of the React capabilities.

At the moment, the functionality is limited only to the shopping cart and filters on the page, but in my opinion it can be refined in such a way that it can become a real site.

This project used such features of React as Context and React-Router.

Also Firebase is used here for the registration and login functionality.

In case you would like to create something similar to it, you will need the following packages: classNames, firebase, yup, formik, react-router-dom, scss

Hope you enjoy using this app!
